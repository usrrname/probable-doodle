Given the things I had read on what makes NFTs so exciting and lucrative, I wanted to know:
- How enforceable are smart contracts on ownership? 
- How are NFT purchases handled?
- Is eth made from sales viewed as income in the same way fiat currency from paid work is?

Here are just a few examples of how NFTs play out in the real world. There are many other areas of law I imagine have not caught up to regulate the creation, profit from and resale of NFTs but the following is just in regards to two areas that concern artists.

## Taxation

Walter et. al also speculate on the tax consequences of NFT purchases that would apply to existing taxation structures. They see opportunity for smart contracts to be structured in a way such that artists receive a portion of the purchase price on every resale. If the NFT was created and donated by the artist, then it should follow that the artist could declare it as a charitable deduction. (How this plays out in practice varies, however.) For sales or exchanges of an NFT, it depends on whether the NFT is categorized as a capital or noncapital asset. For artists these would be deemed ordinary gains and losses, whereas for the purchasers-taxpayers, these would be viewed as capital gains and losses. [^2]

In the US, regulations on the handling of NFTs are still evolving and the IRS hasn't provided explicit guidance on the matter. Crypto/digital currency is [regarded by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf) as property as opposed to currency. The purchase of NFTs creates a taxable event. For American artists, this cuts both ways. They're able to deduct taxes on their artwork as they create it, and they are also able to reap 100% of the profit from sales as taxable income. Self-employment taxes also need to be paid on income generated from sales. [^4]


## Intellectual property

In both Canada and US currently, NFTs aren't protected by copyright. Either they don't meet the basic criteria for copyright protection for ownership and control, or the reasoning behind this is that the smart contract could or would specify how much of proprietary rights are transferred to the purchaser.[^3][^4] Otherwise, the copyright remains with the original copyright owner, which is the artist.

Antonia von Appen at the Art Law Center acknowleges how the transparency of a public register in the form of blockchain as a ledger could build a stronger case for intellectual property. On the other hand she observes the cases of copyright infringement that have occured by dint of exploiting the ability for anyone to create a NFT for whatever work exists, just by simply linking an artist's work to a token.[^5]

This complaint arose from a number of artists in the past year: [Rosa Menkman](https://www.holo.mg/stream/rosa-menkman-nft-crypto-art/), Dead Unweird and even Jean Basquiat's estate discovered their work was sold on an auction site without the artists' intention to mint it. [^6][^7] Anyone can mint an NFT from a digital file, and the current availability of the platforms and technology don't prevent malicious actors from committing art fraud.[^8]

Akhiv Jhirad and Daniel Anthony caution that a NFT purchase might only mean you own a digital version, but it doesn't prevent others from displaying, exhibiting or downloading it (even in the case of display it would constitute copyright infringement) [^9]:

> Purchasers of NFTs should be aware that even though ownership of the authentic digital asset is established through ownership of the NFT, the digital 
> asset itself may be viewed, downloaded, and enjoyed by anyone (for example, the artwork sold on Christie’s can be found online ). In fact, [Christie’s conditions of sale](https://www.christies.com/pdf/onlineonly/ECOMMERCE%20CONDITIONS%20OF%20SALE%20-%20NEW%20YORK%206-16-21%20(002).pdf) [of Beeple's infamous artwork] clearly states:

> “Your purchase of the lot does not provide any rights, express or implied, in (including, without limitation, any copyrights or other intellectual 
> property rights in and to) the digital asset underlying the NFT…”

It's important to remember that laws in different jurisdictions may provide different definitions of copyright and there is no one-size-fits-all answer to how NFT creation and sales are handled from a legal perspective. Ultimately buyers and artists should be informed of the specifics in a smart contract, the legalities behind selling and transferring NFTs. If in doubt, do all the research you can, or save up a lump of money to get legal counsel.
