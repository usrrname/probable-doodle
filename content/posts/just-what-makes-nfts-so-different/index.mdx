### Why are NFTs so special?

The use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a solution to selling art blew up in the past year because an artist [auctioned their NFT piece](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million) for $69M at Christie's, giving the early adopted a nod of acknowlegement this solution has legs.
People who followed this for longer would jump to say the first big heyday around rare unique collectibles was probably [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) trace the idea back to the discussion of [uniquely colored cryptocoins](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/14/colored-coins-paint-sophisticated-future-for-bitcoin/) in 2013.

A NFT is a unit of cryptocurrency powered by Ethereum, an open-source, decentralized blockchain that helps create and validate NFTs. A blockchain is just a database of transactions between computers.
Its currency, ETH, is used to pay for transaction fees (otherwise known as "gas fees").

NFTs have emerged as a novel way to declare originality, authenticity and ownership over some kind of digital or physical thing at the moment â€“assuming the terms around it are enforceable and existing institutions shift to uphold code-as-law.
The latter is what I am unsure about.

In previous incarnations of a "digital art market" as online marketplaces, attempts at selling digital art have been made with by [Paddle8](https://www.paddle8.com/), [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/), [Sedition](https://www.seditionart.com/).[^1] The aforementioned platforms serve the purpose of simply moving art sales online: limit the uniqueness or rarity of artworks and create a more or less happening market with A-listers and premainstream artists. Somewhat alternatively, a startup called [Artery](https://artery.is/) debuted to bring creative spectacles to the public by merging venue listing and hosting with artists looking for opportunities to showcase their talent.

The past years have seen the emergence of platforms like (OpenSea)[https://opensea.io/], [Foundation](https://foundation.app/) and [Hicetunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/). These platforms claim to help artists mint and "drop" their artwork as NFTs, and in turn act as the marketplace for auctioning them. Peers bid on each others works sometimes to raise the relative value of each others' works, til some crytpo-rich person snags it up. Perfect platform collaboration capitalism!

NFTs can be minted to attest to the originality and ownership of anything digital or physical at all: [sneakers](https://www.gq.com/story/nft-fashion-sneakers), digital character costumes, 32-pixel [penguin avatars](https://www.nft-stats.com/collection/32px-penguins), a Tiny house, a [cartoon rock](https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/someone-actually-paid-1-3m-for-an-nft-cartoon-rock/). It seems more attractive than ever to take a stab at collecting rare digital things or daytrading.

And just because I can, does it mean I should?

### The Difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin

There are many similarities between Ethereum and Bitcoin.[^1]
Both are blockchain-based solutions to exchanging digital currency.
Both have extremely opinionated, almost cult-like communities and characters.
Both run on incentive systems that profit maintainers of the system (miners, validators, developers, etc.).
Both offer the promise of a decentralized, transparent and accountable alternative to existing ways of paying for goods and services and exchanging money.

Transactions on blockchain are enabled by the following consensus mechanisms:

- Proof of work: the pre-existing way that Bitcoin and Ethereum are able to maintain, validate and add new blocks to a publicly distributed ledger.[^2]
- Proof of stake: the alternative protocol to the above method. Users with a substantial amount of coin (like, 32 ETH) can stake it towards validating transactions.

The former is computationally intensive and produces a huge carbon footprint; it's what led me to initially dismiss NFTs and mining of crypto to be [utter ecological destruction](https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/).
The latter will reduce the incentive to consume so much energy in order to mine cryptocurrency, but seems to further the existing economic incentives underlying the maintenance of Ethereum.

Hashing, encryption and decryption are par for the course in sending cryptocurrency to another person or creating NFTs to have a secure way verify ownership, sender and receiver. (In my day job, I don't need to understand hashing to build a web application or a login, in fact most devs would not write their own hashing functions since libraries already exist to do that.)

### Smart Contracts

What sets Ethereum apart from Bitcoin is its support of smart contracts during the PoW process.
The contract is a small computer program that executes the business logic attached to the sale, including the owner or recipient of the NFT.

There's been ongoing desire for smart contracts to solve the artist's dread of missed payments, unclear loan and resale agreements, etc.[^3] Who hasn't had a gallerist fall through on shipping their work back despite what's written on a piece of paper you've both signed?

And maybe, just _maybe_ if everyone else agrees with the potential for having the terms of resale and ownership declared in a smart contract, maybe they'll respect the fruits of your labour better?

What is the potential for recovering from error or vulnerability if a smart contract isn't written well in code?

If one of the defining features of NFTs is that it's immutable, the great part is that no one can go in and change the contract, tamper with the value of the asset, etc.

The Consensys best practice guide for developing smart contracts preaches 100% test coverage prior to contract rollout.[^4] What if by dint of human error, you, impeccable coder, forget to cover an edge case, allowed weak typing or made a function public when it should have been private?
The damage would have been done if the smart contract has been published.
