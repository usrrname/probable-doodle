Here are some things I've heard people gripe about in regards to NFTs and Ethereum.

## Paying to Play

You have to buy ETH to mint or buy NFTs, or to bid on NFTs on decentralized apps. A mass of artists and daytime collectors jumping onto the NFT train will only serves to raise the value of ethereum and drive up gas prices (transaction fees for using the Ethereum network to mint NFTs, mine coin or transfer currency). This in turns requires artists or whoever is purchasing to pay more. It's human nature to want to pay as little as possible and still be able to benefit from a service. 

And of course, any service should have fees and charges tied to operations and overhead, ultimately who gains from the entire system?

## Misaligned Incentives

Satoshi Nakamoto, ["Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Cash System"](http://satoshinakamoto.me/bitcoin.pdf). 2008

Mining involves multiple computers competing to solve puzzles at the same time. (Imagine systematically trying every combination you can think of to crack a friend's Facebook password.) However, only one computer will win and the rest just have to give up despite expending all the energy to come up with the correct answer. (That's where the waste of energy comes from). The one that solves the answer gets to produce the next block on the chain and is rewarded with eth for doing so. (Don't forget that every block on the chain needs to be updated after a block is added or a smart contract is run... thus requiring more energy and time.) 

Bitcoin and Ethereum are systems designed to reward its maintainers: the miners... or more often, the owners of mining pool companies.[^1] Miners can "pool" their computational energy together to increase the chances of finding a proof-of-work and adding a new block. In fact if the original purpose of bitcoin was to give every user a chance of using their own computers to "passively" generate income through mining (and eventually validating), the computational and energy needs are so immense that roughly 65-70% of the world's mining activity occurs in data centers in China.[^2] It's likely this industry has relocated to the US since the crackdown on mining transactions by the Peoples Bank of China in advance of debuting its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).[^3]

To go one level up, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) claim to provide a democratic way for currency owners to participate in governance of Ethereum and the way rewards are spent. However, the accretion of membership within mining pools and DAOs can give these groups more political power to deterimine the course of ethereum than individual users, thus setting up differing classes of citizenship in the community.

## Carbon Offsetting Is Flawed

We want our art and passion work to be morally hygienic, the meat we eat to have happily died for us. The cognitive dissonance has never been stronger and carbon offsetting begs the question of whether the ends justifies the means. (Not to make light of our general gig-working artist who has 2 or 3 precarious jobs, most of which have been made redundant by Covid. I do have friends who paid rent by cashing out bitcoin and eth at some point.)

There's a ton already written out there on this subject so I won't belabor it.[^4]

Kyle McDonald's project, ["ethereum-nft-activity"](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ethereum-nft-activity) uses Python scripts to pull transaction data from popular NFT art platforms and makes estimations of daily carbon output according to Ethereum activity on popular NFT art platforms. A separate [repo](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ethereum-energy) contains the scripts for using benchmarks of GPU power to find the per-day energy consumption of Ethereum. 

McDonald admits there may be a high margin of error between the intensities of mining pool companies, but what I find most fascinating is the rising amount of fees as part of NFT transactions over time.

Counterarguments to the ecological complaint include:
- People are focusing and scapegoating NFT-minting for emissions because there's data around it, but there's a lack of data around the art world's comparative carbon emissions to make an accurate comparison. [^5]
- NFTs only account for a small portion of Ethereum's activity 
- There's no direct correlation between increased transaction activity and carbon output

## Many NFTs are "locked in" on the blockchain they were created on

Most NFTs are currently not interoperable between blockchains, even though they can be transferred between wallets.[^6] This runs counter to the idea of NFTs as interchangeable assets within a defi ecosystem. Longterm, this could be viewed as a risk in the same way you aren't able to trade one chain's item for the value of another, leading to isolated community-markets. A tangible example would be the inability to use CrytoPunk in a Crytpokitties game. [^7]

## Burning physical artworks in attempt to increase the value of NFT art

In March 2021, Injective Protocol (a Defi trading company) who bought a $95,000 Banksy recorded its burning as it was converted to a NFT, in great gesture to make the NFT the only thing representing the artwork in digital form.[^8]
This isn't an inherent problem of the technology, this is moreso a problem of how humans are responding to new tech: destruction of culture for the sake of making headlines.

## Burning NFTs to increase the value of the underlying coin

In 2017, Mitchell Chan released "Digital Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility", a project that copies of works of fine art and would also allow the owner of the NFT to use a smart contract function he included to burn the NFT representing the artwork. Apparently the work is based on Yves Klein's work. (To his credit, the project was launched a couple months before CryptoKitties, which deserves some kind of applaud for "first dibs" on the idea.) [^9]

This happens on the market, and ironically, in art too.

## Just because you mint, does not mean you will sell

There is no magical connection between creating NFT and art sales. Not every gets to be Beeple. But you might stand a good chance if you have the influence and outreach and sponsorship of a community to match its value. In particular, Karen Darricades of Creative Commons Canada observes that artists with a higher social media follower count tend to succeed with NFT sales.[^9] In attempt to qualify the value of NFT art for buyers, [Haug and Partners](https://www.haugpartners.com/article/valuation-of-nfts-factors-to-consider-and-an-alternative-to-destroying-the-original-work/) mention the way an artists' pre-mainstream or A-List status also informs the valuation of their artwork.[^10] 

As much as we hear of the successes of cartoon rocks and avatar costume parts being sold, similarly pages and pages of tokenized art sit unsold or sell for way lower than the existing art market would pay for it.[^11][^12] At the end of the day, a sales marketplace makes sales less about art but the speculative value of an artist and how they've chosen to monetize their work. 

## The existence of a NFT does not ensure authentic authorship by an artist

Some tech firms have proposed NFTs unlock a use case for identity verification. On the other hand, platforms like OpenSea, Rarible and Marbl don't enforce identity verfication when an artwork is minted, other than through the use of social media handles. This leaves artists vulnerable to people minting their work and selling it for profit.[^13]

[^5] "Ironically, because blockchains give the world such a transparent and accurate accounting of the energy consumption of our industry, they provide a tangible number to focus and dwell on, which has led to a double standard being applied to our industry. Because there is no blockchain to account for the carbon footprint of the traditional art world, which includes, inter alia, all of the private and commercial air travel to the Basels, Biennales, and countless other festivals around the world, not to mention the automobile traffic to gallery exhibitions, museums, and so forth, such criticism has not been leveled against the offline art world, despite the fact that its carbon footprint is orders of magnitude greater."
