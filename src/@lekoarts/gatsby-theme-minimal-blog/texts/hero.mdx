I'm an [artist](https://jennifer-chan.com) and software developer living in Toronto.

For the months of September and Hacktober I'm going to learn all I can about NFTs and blog about it. 

PS: I had a short stint as an academic and you can find my [previous writing](https://saic.academia.edu/JenniferChan).
